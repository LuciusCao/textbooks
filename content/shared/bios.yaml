archimedes:
  name: Archimedes
  bio: |
    __Archimedes__ (c. 287 – c. 212 BC) was an ancient Greek scientist and
    engineer, and one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. He discovered
    many concepts of calculus, and worked in geometry, analysis and mechanics.

    While taking a bath, Archimedes discovered a way to determine the volume of
    irregular objects using the amount of water they displaced when submerged.
    He was so excited by this discovery that he run out on the street, still
    undressed, yelling _“Eureka!”_ (Greek for _“I have found it!”_).

    As engineer he built ingenious defence machines during the siege of his home
    city Syracuse in Sicily. After two years, the Romans finally managed to
    enter and Archimedes as killed. His last words were _“Do not disturb my
    circles”_ – which he was studying at the time.

    In 1637, he wrote a short note in the margin of one of his textbooks,
    claiming that the equation `a^n + b^n = c^n` has no integer solutions for
    `n > 2`, and that he had a “marvelous proof, which this margin is too narrow
    to contain”. This became known as _Fermat's Last Theorem_, and became one of
